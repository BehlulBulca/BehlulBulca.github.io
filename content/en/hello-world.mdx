## Introduction

Welcome to my new portfolio. This project represents more than just a showcase of my work; it's a playground for experimenting with modern web technologies and refined design aesthetics.

## Tech Stack

I chose a robust, production-ready stack that prioritizes performance and developer experience:

- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling
- **Internationalization**: [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) for seamless English/Turkish support
- **Animations**: `animejs` for precise timeline control and custom `FadeIn` components
- **Content**: MDX for writing blog posts with component flexibility

## Design Philosophy

The design aims for a **"Minimalist Premium"** aesthetic. Key elements include:

- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle translucent layers (`backdrop-blur`) to create depth.
- **Typography**: A pairing of **Playfair Display** (Serif) for headings and **Inter** (Sans) for body text, creating an editorial feel.
- **Wireframe Aesthetics**: The hero section uses custom ASCII-style wireframe art to symbolize the intersection of code and design.

## Key Features

1.  **Fully Localized**: Every page, including blog posts, supports English and Turkish.
2.  **Dark/Light Mode Ready**: Built with CSS variables for easy theming (currently optimized for a light/clean look).
3.  **Responsive**: flawless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
4.  **Performance**: Static generation for blog posts ensures lightning-fast load times.

## Code Snippet

Here is how the fade-in animation component is implemented:

```tsx
export function FadeIn({ children, delay = 0, className }: Props) {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    anime({
      targets: ref.current,
      opacity: [0, 1],
      translateY: [20, 0],
      delay,
      easing: 'easeOutExpo',
      duration: 800
    });
  }, [delay]);

  return <div ref={ref} className={className}>{children}</div>;
}
```

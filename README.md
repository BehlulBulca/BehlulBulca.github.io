# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and professional interests. It is designed to be included in a CV and for public viewing on GitHub Pages.

The project was developed using React and Vite, featuring a minimalist dark theme, internationalization (English and Turkish), and a responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Key Features

- **Framework/Tooling**: React, Vite
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: i18next
- **Styling**: Standard CSS with a focus on CSS Modules principles, responsive design with media queries.
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages via `gh-pages` package.
- **Theme**: Custom minimalist dark theme with a global fixed Navbar and consistent styling across pages (Home, About, Projects, Contact).

## Development

This project was bootstrapped from a standard Vite + React template.

### Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
- `npm run deploy`: Builds the app and deploys it to GitHub Pages.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the project files (if ESLint is configured).

## Acknowledgements

This project was developed with the assistance of AI. I utilized GitHub Copilot for guidance on code implementation, debugging, and best practices throughout the development process.

_The following is the original README content from the Vite + React template:_

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

About Me

I am a curious and motivated 4th-year Econometrics student at Uludağ University, driven by a passion for Data Science, Financial Technology, and Full-Stack Development. My journey is defined by a commitment to translating theoretical knowledge into practical, high-value applications.

Academic & International Journey My academic foundation began in 2022 and was significantly enriched by an Erasmus+ mobility program at the Eastern European University of Applied Sciences in Białystok, Poland. This experience not only broadened my perspective on multicultural environments but also enhanced my adaptability—a skill I apply to every new technical challenge I face.

Professional Experience I currently work as a Student Assistant at the Uludağ University Career Application and Research Center. In this role, I have transitioned from general IT support to active development, where I am building the center's new website using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. Previously, I served as a Faculty Intern, managing IT operations and administrative workflows for the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences.

Technical Expertise & Projects Beyond my coursework, I have developed a strong proficiency in Python, R, and JavaScript. I am particularly focused on financial data analysis and machine learning. One of my key projects involves developing a comprehensive stock prediction platform (BIST30) utilizing TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM), FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.

I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my skills in Deep Learning and Web Technologies, with the goal of pursuing a Master's degree in AI or Data Science in Europe.
